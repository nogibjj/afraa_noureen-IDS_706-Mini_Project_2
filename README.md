## Mini-Project 2 : Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script

[![CI](https://github.com/afraa-n/IDS_706-Mini_Project_2/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/afraa-n/IDS_706-Mini_Project_2/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

#### Goal of the Project
This project modifies an existing Github template by handling the loading and manipulation of a movie dataset stored in a .csv file using the Pandas library. This entails extracting meaningful insights from the dataset by generating descriptive statistics.

The core functionality of this project involves identifying and presenting the movies with the highest ratings from the dataset. 

The accompanying Makefile automates essential development tasks, making it easier for developers to maintain code quality, run tests, and streamline the development workflow.

Dataset used: [Top-Rated Movies Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khalidalam980/top-rated-movies-data-set)
